                        As you already know, I'm pinhead, but you can also call me Max. I live in the state of Minnesota
                        and my birthday is on September 13th, '04. I'm also bisexual and very much love my boyfriend!
                        <br><br>
                        As an avid programmer and I very much enjoy scripting, designing, and gaming, and you'll often
                        find me doing one of those things. The inspiration to create this site came from a mix of my
                        friends making their sites and my desire to eventually have one to call my own, leading to the
                        creating of this site and the ownership of this domain. I have many, many ideas in store, so
                        stay tuned to this site or my server to learn more about what I plan to do!
                        <br><br>
                        My personality side is definitely what one would expect from an introverted programmer though,
                        I think of myself to be a soft person yet still caring about those around me. I generally avoid
                        conflict and enjoy just remaining kind in most situations. I like talking more than describing
                        myself though, so come and have a chat instead!
